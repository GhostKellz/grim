# 🚀 GRIM Performance Improvements - Priority 2 & 3 Complete!

**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Focus:** High-impact performance optimizations for phantom.grim

---

## ✅ COMPLETED IMPROVEMENTS

### 1. Zero-Copy Rope Operations ⚡

**Problem:** Rope `slice()` was leaking memory and always copying data

**Solution:**
- Added `RopeIterator` for true zero-copy segment iteration
- Fixed `slice()` to use arena allocator (prevents leaks)
- Single-piece slices use zero-copy fast path
- Fixed critical bugs in `splitPiece()` (now immutable)

**API:**
```zig
// Zero-copy iteration over segments
var iter = rope.iterator(.{ .start = 0, .end = rope.len() });
while (iter.next()) |segment| {
    // Process segment without copying!
}

// Convenient slice (zero-copy for single piece, arena for multi)
const data = try rope.slice(.{ .start = 0, .end = 100 });
// No manual free needed - tied to rope lifetime
```

**Impact:**
- Zero-copy slice: **7µs** (~142k ops/sec)
- No memory leaks
- Reduced allocations

---

### 2. Comprehensive Benchmark Suite 📊

**Added:** `core/rope_bench.zig` with detailed performance measurements

**Build command:** `zig build bench -Doptimize=ReleaseFast`

**Benchmark Results:**

| Operation | Time | Throughput |
|-----------|------|------------|
| Zero-copy slice (single piece) | 7µs | ~142k ops/sec |
| Multi-piece slice (arena) | 19µs | ~53k ops/sec |
| Zero-copy iterator | 19µs | ~52k ops/sec |
| Insert small (5 bytes) | 14µs | ~70k ops/sec |
| Insert medium (75 bytes) | 14µs | ~72k ops/sec |
| Insert multiple (4 pieces) | 19µs | ~52k ops/sec |
| Delete small (6 bytes) | 7µs | ~143k ops/sec |
| Line count (O(1) cached) | 7µs | ~130k ops/sec |
| Line range lookup | 7µs | ~134k ops/sec |
| Snapshot + Restore | 7µs | ~140k ops/sec |
| Large file (1000 lines) | 107µs | ~9k ops/sec |

**Benchmarks cover:**
- Insert operations (small/medium/multiple)
- Delete operations
- Slice operations (zero-copy vs arena)
- Iterator performance
- Line operations (count/range)
- Snapshot/restore
- Large file handling

### 3. Event Batching System 📦

**Problem:** Events fired immediately one-by-one (overhead for rapid events)

**Solution:** Added batching to `BufferEventsAPI`

**API:**
```zig
// Begin batching
events.beginBatch();

// These events are queued, not fired immediately
try events.emit(.text_changed, payload1);
try events.emit(.text_changed, payload2);
try events.emit(.cursor_moved, payload3);

// End batch - all events fire at once
try events.endBatch();
```

**Features:**
- Nested batching support (only outermost `endBatch()` flushes)
- `flushBatch()` for manual flushing
- `batchSize()` and `isBatching()` for introspection
- Zero overhead when not batching

**Impact on Phantom.grim:**
- Batch plugin events during lazy loading
- Batch bulk operations (multiple edits)
- Batch startup initialization events
- Significantly reduced event handler overhead

---

### 4. Bug Fixes 🐛

Fixed critical bugs discovered during optimization:

1. **`snapshot()` bug:** Used `pieces.len` instead of `pieces.items.len`
2. **`restore()` bug:** Improperly reconstructed piece array
3. **`splitPiece()` bug:** Mutated pieces (broke snapshots!)
   - Now creates new immutable pieces instead
4. **Memory leak in `slice()`:** Used wrong allocator
   - Now uses arena allocator (auto-cleanup)

## 📈 OVERALL IMPACT

### Performance Wins:
- ✅ Zero-copy operations (massive memory reduction)
- ✅ O(1) cached line counting (was O(n))
- ✅ Event batching (reduced overhead)
- ✅ No memory leaks
- ✅ Rock-solid snapshot/restore

### For Phantom.grim:
- **Faster text operations** across the board
- **Lower memory usage** (zero-copy iterator)
- **Batched plugin events** for lazy loading
- **Benchmarks** to track future optimizations
- **Stable undo/redo** (fixed snapshot bugs)
