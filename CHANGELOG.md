## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### Code Navigation & LSP Features (Latest)

  - `Theme.loadFromFile()` stub for TOML config loading
  - Exported types: `Theme`, `Color`
  - Runtime theme switching foundation
- **Render Cache**: High-performance syntax highlighting
  - Content hash-based caching prevents re-parsing
  - `highlight_dirty` flag system for smart invalidation
  - Zero overhead when content unchanged

  - Graceful degradation when parser unavailable
  - Comprehensive fallback tokenizer for all languages
  - Handles: comments, strings, numbers, keywords, identifiers, operators
  - Error boundaries around all Grove/tree-sitter calls
  - 4 new smoke tests for fallback tokenizer (all passing âœ“)

#### Core System Improvements
- **SimpleTUI Compilation Fixes**: Resolved Zig 0.16 compatibility issues
  - Fixed `File.writer()` API changes requiring buffer parameter
  - Updated rope slice API to use mutable references where needed
  - Fixed deprecated `std.math.min` â†’ `@min` usage
