## Overview

**Grim** is a modern, performant alternative to Vim/Neovim.  
Built in **Zig**, it preserves the **modal editing power** of Vim while providing:

- **Instant startup** and low memory footprint  
- **Ghostlang plugin system** (typed, modern alternative to Lua)  
- **Tree-sitter integration** for fast, incremental syntax parsing  
- **First-class LSP support** out of the box  
- **TUI first**, with future GPU-accelerated GUI support  

Our goal is simple:  
**Keep the Vim motions, drop the baggage, and make editing blazing fast.**
