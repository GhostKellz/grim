## Overview

**Grim** is a modern, performant alternative to Vim/Neovim.  
Built in **Zig**, it preserves the **modal editing power** of Vim while providing:

- **Instant startup** and low memory footprint  
- **Ghostlang plugin system** (typed, modern alternative to Lua)  
- **Tree-sitter integration** for fast, incremental syntax parsing  
- **First-class LSP support** out of the box  
- **TUI first**, with future GPU-accelerated GUI support  

Our goal is simple:  
**Keep the Vim motions, drop the baggage, and make editing blazing fast.**

## Features

- ðŸ”‘ Modal editing with Vim motions  
- ðŸª¶ Rope-based buffer for huge files  :
- ðŸŒ² Tree-sitter 0.25.10 highlighting and navigation across 14 languages  
- ðŸ“¡ Built-in LSP client (hover, diagnostics, goto, completion)  
- âš¡ Ghostlang configuration and plugins  
- ðŸ”Œ Remote plugin protocol (any language over stdio/JSON)  
- ðŸ“‚ Fuzzy finder, quickfix list, registers, macros  

### Supported languages (via Grove)

Grim bundles Grove's latest tree-sitter toolchain. When you build with `-Dghostlang=true`, you get:

- Zig, Rust, Go
- JavaScript, TypeScript, TSX
- Python, Bash, C, C++
- JSON, TOML, YAML, Markdown
- CMake, HTML, CSS
- Ghostlang utilities (symbols, folding, text objects)
